# Cell-Universe: Space of the Cellular Machines

![Actual State](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Art-Stea1th/Cell-Universe/master/Screenshots/main.png)

### Graphic visualizer of [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) operation

> High performance. Completely on .NET FCL, C#, WPF. Not are used graphics or other third-party libraries.

#### Currently supported by two versions invented by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) and [Edward Fredkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Fredkin).


* The initial conditions of the universe are given by a [pseudorandom number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) with a [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)).

* You can select the resolution of the Universe from 1x1 to 1920x1080 cells.
* It is possible to regulate the rate of evolution of the Universe.
* For a more beautiful visualization, it is also possible to display up to 64 layers of history, but maximum performance is achieved without this option.

> It is recommended to start with the John Conway algorithm. Switching to the Edward Fredkin algorithm is recommended after John Conway's algorithm, at the stage when most of the cells "die out". Preliminarily reduce the speed to a minimum, otherwise you will not have time to see the replicants, which quickly fill the entire space :)

### [Releases:](https://github.com/Art-Stea1th/Cell-Universe/releases)
